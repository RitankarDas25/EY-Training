[/INST]", "response": "Reinforcement Learning, in simple terms, is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve a goal. The agent receives rewards or penalties for the actions it takes, and over time, it learns to associate actions that lead to higher rewards with positive outcomes, and actions that lead to lower rewards with negative outcomes. The goal is to find a policy, a set of rules that dictate the best action to take in each situation, to maximize the total reward over time. This learning process often requires trial and error, as the agent must explore various actions and their consequences to learn the optimal policy.", "feedback": null}
